# Motivations

I'm motivated by a desire to have a career where I get to continue to learn. If I'm bored and feel like a plateau has been reached, I'm going to want to do something else. I don't think a lot of programmers hit that wall. You have to keep learning or eventually you're going to be behind the curve.
